# Project-Diabetes
Project name: Predictive analysis of diabetes incidence using machine learning algorithms

Description: As part of a Data Science project, I conducted a predictive analysis to identify factors influencing diabetes risk. The project was based on a clinical dataset.

Technologies used:
Data processing and analysis using Pandas and NumPy libraries.
Data visualisation using Matplotlib and Seaborn tools.
Machine learning model implementation and tuning using scikit-learn.
Evaluating model performance through recall metrics.
Working with Jupyter Notebook to document project steps and results.

This project allowed me to put into practice skills related to data analysis, machine learning and visualisation, taught me how to work in a team and solve problems related to medical data.
